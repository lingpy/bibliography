  year = {2003},
  volume = {424},
  pages = {900},
  abstract = {(Whole article):
	
	Thousands of the world’s languages are vanishing at an alarming rate,
	with 90% of them being expected to disappear with the current generation1.
	Here we develop a simple model of language competition that explains
	historical data on the decline of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic, Quechua
	(the most common surviving indigenous language in the Americas) and
	other endangered languages. A linguistic parameter that quantifies
	the threat of language extinction can be derived from the model and
	may be useful in the design and evaluation of language-preservation
	programmes. Previous models of language dynamics have focused on
	the transmission and evolution of syntax, grammar or other structural
	properties of a language itself 2–7. In contrast, the model we describe
	here idealizes languages as fixed, and as competing with each other
	for speakers. For simplicity, we also assume a highly connected population,with
	no spatial or social structure, in which all speakers are monolingual.
	Consider a system of two competing languages, X and Y,in which the
	attractiveness of a language increases with both its number of speakers
	and its perceived status8 (a parameter that reflects the social or
	economic opportunities afforded to its speakers). Suppose an individual
	converts from Y to X with a probability, per unit of time, of Pyx(x,s),
	where x is the fraction of the population speaking X, and 0s1 is
	a measure of X’s relative status. A minimal model for language change
	is therefore d—xyPyx(x,s)xPxy(x,s) (1) dt where y1x is the complementary
	fraction of the population speaking Y at time t. By symmetry, interchanging
	languages should yield the same transition probability as a swap
	in the fraction of speakers and relative status; thus Pxy(x,s)Pyx(1x,1s).
	We also assume that no one will adopt a language that has no speakers
	(Pyx(0,s)0) or no status (Pyx(x,0)0), and that Pyx is smooth and
	monotonically increasing in both arguments. These mild assumptions
	imply that equation (1) generically has three fixed points.Of these,
	only x0 and x1 are stable. The model therefore predicts that two
	languages cannot coexist stably — one will eventually drive the other
	to extinction. To test our model, we collected data on the number
	of speakers of endangered languages in 42 regions of Peru,Scotland,Wales,
	Bolivia, Ireland and Alsace-Lorraine, four instances of which are
	shown in Fig. 1.We fit the model’s solutions to the data, assuming
	transition functions of the forms Pyx(x,s)cxas and Pxy(x,s)c(1x)a(1s).
	Unexpectedly, the exponent a was found to be roughly constant across
	cultures, with a1.310.25 (meanstandard deviation; further details
	are available from the authors). Of the remaining parameters, status,
	s, is the most relevant linguistically; it could serve as a useful
	measure of the threat to a given language. Quechua, for example,
	still has many speakers in Huanuco, Peru, but its low status is driving
	a rapid shift to Spanish, which leads to an unfortunate situation
	in which a child cannot communicate with his or her grandparents.
	Contrary to the model’s stark prediction, bilingual societies do,
	in fact, exist. But the histories of countries where two languages
	coexist today generally involve split populations that lived without
	significant interaction, effectively in separate, monolingual societies.
	Only recently have these communities begun to mix, allowing language
	competition to begin. So what can be done to prevent the rapid disintegration
	of our world’s linguistic heritage? The example of Quebec French
	demonstrates that language decline can be slowed by strategies such
	as policy-making, education and advertising, in essence increasing
	an endangered language’s status. An extension to equation (1) that
	incorporates such control on s through active feedback does indeed
	show stabilization of a bilingual fixed point.},

  abstract = {We present a mathematical formulation of a theory of language change.
	The theory is evolutionary in nature and has close analogies with
	theories of population genetics. The mathematical structure we construct
	similarly has correspondences with the Fisher-Wright model of population
	genetics, but there are significant differences. The continuous time
	formulation of the model is expressed in terms of a Fokker-Planck
	equation. This equation is exactly soluble in the case of a single
	speaker and can be investigated analytically in the case of multiple
	speakers who communicate equally with all other speakers and give
	their utterances equal weight. Whilst the stationary properties of
	this system have much in common with the single-speaker case, time-dependent
	properties are richer. In the particular case where linguistic forms
	can become extinct, we find that the presence of many speakers causes
	a two-stage relaxation, the first being a common marginal distribution
	that persists for a long time as a consequence of ultimate extinction
	being due to rare fluctuations.},

  abstract = { <p>In recent years, linguists have begun to increasingly rely on
	quantitative phylogenetic approaches to examine language evolution.
	Some linguists have questioned the suitability of phylogenetic approaches
	on the grounds that linguistic evolution is largely reticulate due
	to extensive lateral transmission, or borrowing, among languages.
	The problem may be particularly pronounced in hunter-gatherer languages,
	where the conventional wisdom among many linguists is that lexical
	borrowing rates are so high that tree building approaches cannot
	provide meaningful insights into evolutionary processes. However,
	this claim has never been systematically evaluated, in large part
	because suitable data were unavailable. In addition, little is known
	about the subsistence, demographic, ecological, and social factors
	that might mediate variation in rates of borrowing among languages.
	Here, we evaluate these claims with a large sample of hunter-gatherer
	languages from three regions around the world. In this study, a list
	of 204 basic vocabulary items was collected for 122 hunter-gatherer
	and small-scale cultivator languages from three ecologically diverse
	case study areas: northern Australia, northwest Amazonia, and California
	and the Great Basin. Words were rigorously coded for etymological
	(inheritance) status, and loan rates were calculated. Loan rate variability
	was examined with respect to language area, subsistence mode, and
	population size, density, and mobility; these results were then compared
	to the sample of 41 primarily agriculturalist languages in <xref
	ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0025195-Haspelmath1">[1]</xref>. Though
	loan levels varied both within and among regions, they were generally
	low in all regions (mean 5.06%, median 2.49%, and SD 7.56), despite
	substantial demographic, ecological, and social variation. Amazonian
	levels were uniformly very low, with no language exhibiting more
	than 4%. Rates were low but more variable in the other two study
	regions, in part because of several outlier languages where rates
	of borrowing were especially high. High mobility, prestige asymmetries,
	and language shift may contribute to the high rates in these outliers.
	No support was found for claims that hunter-gatherer languages borrow
	more than agriculturalist languages. These results debunk the myth
	of high borrowing in hunter-gatherer languages and suggest that the
	evolution of these languages is governed by the same type of rules
	as those operating in large-scale agriculturalist speech communities.
	The results also show that local factors are likely to be more critical
	than general processes in determining high (or low) loan rates.</p>

	underlying these regularities? To examine this, we determined a wide
	variety of topologically distinct contour configurations and examined
	the relative frequency of these configuration types across writing
	systems, Chinese writing, and nonlinguistic symbols. Our first result
	is that these three classes of human visual sign possess a similar
	signature in their configuration distribution, suggesting that there
	are underlying principles governing the shapes of human visual signs.
	Second, we provide evidence that the shapes of visual signs are selected
	to be easily seen at the expense of the motor system. Finally, we
	provide evidence to support an ecological hypothesis that visual
	signs have been culturally selected to match the kinds of conglomeration
	of contours found in natural scenes because that is what we have
	evolved to be good at visually processing.},

  abstract = {Bacterial evolution is characterized by frequent gain and loss events
	of gene families. These events can be inferred from phyletic pattern
	data—a compact representation of gene family repertoire across multiple
	genomes. The maximum parsimony paradigm is a classical and prevalent
	approach for the detection of gene family gains and losses mapped
	on specific branches. We and others have previously developed probabilistic
	models that aim to account for the gain and loss stochastic dynamics.
	These models are a critical component of a methodology termed stochastic
	mapping, in which probabilities and expectations of gain and loss
	events are estimated for each branch of an underlying phylogenetic
	tree. In this work, we present a phyletic pattern simulator in which
	the gain and loss dynamics are assumed to follow a continuous-time
	Markov chain along the tree. Various models and options are implemented
	to make the simulation software useful for a large number of studies
	in which binary (presence/absence) data are analyzed. Using this
	simulation software, we compared the ability of the maximum parsimony
	and the stochastic mapping approaches to accurately detect gain and
	loss events along the tree. Our simulations cover a large array of
	evolutionary scenarios in terms of the propensities for gene family
	gains and losses and the variability of these propensities among
	gene families. Although in all simulation schemes, both methods obtain
	relatively low levels of false positive rates, stochastic mapping
	outperforms maximum parsimony in terms of true positive rates. We
	further studied the factors that influence the performance of both
	methods. We find, for example, that the accuracy of maximum parsimony
	inference is substantially reduced when the goal is to map gain and
	loss events along internal branches of the phylogenetic tree. Furthermore,
	the accuracy of stochastic mapping is reduced with smaller data sets
	(limited number of gene families) due to unreliable estimation of
	branch lengths. Our simulator and simulation results are additionally
	relevant for the analysis of other types of binary-coded data, such
	as the existence of homologues restriction sites, gaps, and introns,
	to name a few. Both the simulation software and the inference methodology
	are freely available at a user-friendly server: http://gloome.tau.ac.il/.},

  abstract = {Motivation:In recent years, several methods have been proposed for
	aligning two protein sequence profiles, with reported improvements
	in alignment accuracy and homolog discrimination versus sequence-sequence
	methods (e.g. BLAST) and profile-sequence methods (e.g. PSI-BLAST).
	Profile-profile alignment is also the iterated step in progressive
	multiple sequence alignment algorithms such as CLUSTALW. However,
	little is known about the relative performance of different profile-profile
	scoring functions. In this work, we evaluate the alignment accuracy
	of 23 different profile-profile scoring functions by comparing alignments
	of 488 pairs of sequences with identity [<=]30% against structural
	alignments. We optimize parameters for all scoring functions on the
	same training set and use profiles of alignments from both PSI-BLAST
	and SAM-T99. Structural alignments are constructed from a consensus
	between the FSSP database and CE structural aligner. We compare the
	results with sequence-sequence and sequence-profile methods, including
	BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Results: We find that profile-profile alignment
	gives an average improvement over our test set of typically 2-3%
	over profile-sequence alignment and [~]40% over sequence-sequence
	alignment. No statistically significant difference is seen in the
	relative performance of most of the scoring functions tested. Significantly
	better results are obtained with profiles constructed from SAM-T99
	alignments than from PSI-BLAST alignments. Availability: Source code,
	reference alignments and more detailed results are freely available

  abstract = {Consonantal weakening has long been recognized as a significant, natural
	type of phonological change. Weakening can be defined as a systematic
	reduction process, often resulting in deletion, which affects certain
	consonants, depending on their position within the word or the phonological
	phrase. For example, weakening may include some or all of the following
	successive stages: voicing, spirantization, gliding, deletion, such
	as t&gt;d&gt;o&amp;#x030B;&gt;Ø (cf. Latin vita; Mod. French vie
	[vi]; Mod. Spanish vida [vio&amp;#x030B;a] ‘life’).
	
	My intent in this paper is to point out some interesting aspects of
	the mechanism of weakening, and more specifically to address myself
	to the issue of its representation in phonological theory. Within
	a transformational-generative framework, the ‘grammar change’ analysis
	(Halle 1962; Kiparsky 1968, 1971; King 1972) can superficially describe
	the formal progression of t&gt;d&gt;o&amp;#x030B;&gt;Ø in terms of
	a series of rule additions. However, such an analysis has no explanatory
	value whatsoever if the overall continuity of the weakening process
	is overlooked. In order to remedy the main inadequacies of the ‘grammar
	change’ analysis, I propose to incorporate a set of hierarchies into
	phonological theory. These hierarchies will represent the crucial
	phonological relationships which account for the systematic stages,
	the directionality and the scope of consonantal weakening. It will
	be argued that three types of information must be included, namely,
	reference to environmental factors, to manner of articulation and
	voicing properties, and to place of articulation features.},

  abstract = {This article tests earlier claims about the universality of patterns
	of polysemy and semantic extension in the domain of perception verbs.
	Utilizing data from a broad range (approx. 60) of Australian languages,
	we address two hypothesized universals. The first is Viberg's (1984)
	proposed unidirectional pattern of extension from higher to lower
	sensory modalities (i.e. INTRAFIELD extensions, like 'see' > 'hear').
	The second hypothesized universal is that put forward by Sweetser
	(1990) regarding the extension of perception verbs to cognition readings
	(i.e. TRANSFIELD extensions, like 'see' > 'know'). She suggests that
	vision has primacy as the modality from which verbs of higher intellection,
	such as 'knowing' and 'thinking', are recruited, and proposes that
	verbs meaning 'hear' would not take on these readings, although they
	often extend to mean 'understand' or 'obey'. Though both hypotheses
	assign primacy to vision among the senses, the results of our Australian
	study show that Viberg's proposal remains intact, while Sweetser's
	is proved false. Australian languages recruit verbs of cognition
	like 'think' and 'know' from 'hear', but not from 'see'. It appears
	that, at least as far as perception verbs are concerned, transfield
	semantic changes are subject to greater cultural variability than
	intrafield semantic changes. We argue that the same semantic domain
	can have its UNIVERSAL and its RELATIVISTIC side, a foot in nature
	and a foot in culture, and conclude by demonstrating that there are
	good social and cultural reasons driving the extension of 'hearing',
	but not 'seeing', to 'know' and 'think' in Australian Aboriginal
	societies.},

  abstract = {In diachronic studies of Chinese syntax, an interesting question is
	why the two SOV structures, [wh-object V] and [Neg Pro-object V]
	in Early Archaic Chinese (EAC, 1000-500 B.C.), disappeared after
	the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.). This paper proposes that these two notable
	OV orders in EAC are structurally distinct and that the structure
	of [wh V] is also different from that of [wh Neg/Aux V]. Furthermore,
	it is argued that Proto-Chinese is an SOV language and that the change
	from SOV (Proto-Chinese) to SVO (EAC) caused a stress shift from
	preverbal to postverbal position. According to the theory developed
	here, some problems that have remained in the syntax of Classical
	Chinese cease to exist, including the following: Why did the two
	OV structures remain in EAC? Why did the [wh-object V] order disappear
	later than the [Neg Pro-object V] order? Why did monosyllabic wh-words
	(e.g., he 'what') but not disyllabic wh-expressions (e.g., he-shi
	'what thing') immediately precede the verb? And why was the disappearance
	of the [wh-object V] structure followed by a development of disyllabic
	wh-words (e.g., he wu 'what thing' &gt hewu 'what')? Each of these
	questions is answered in terms of prosody. The arguments made here
	claim that prosody is very important in resolving questions of how
	syntactic changes take place.},

  abstract = {Four algorithms, A–D, were developed to align two groups of biological
	sequences. Algorithm A is equivalent to the conventional dynamic
	programming method widely used for aligning ordinary sequences, whereas
	algorithms B – D are designed to evaluate the cost for a deletion/insertion
	more accurately when internal gaps are present in either or both
	groups of sequences. Rigorous optimization of the ‘sum of pairs’
	(SP) score is achieved by algorithm D, whose average performance
	is close to O(MNL2) where M and N are numbers of sequences included
	in the two groups and L is the mean length of the sequences. Algorithm
	B uses some app mximations to cope with profile-based operations,
	whereas algorithm C is a simpler variant of algorithm D. These group-to-group
	alignment algorithms were applied to multiple sequence alignment
	with two iterative strategies: a progressive method based on a given
	binary tree and a randomized grouping-realignment method. The advantages
	and disadvantages of the four algorithms are discussed on the basis
	of the results of exatninations of several protein families.},

	Grounded on Chung's (1996) autosegmental model, the current analysis
	is characterized by six points: (a) Every syllable has an XXX template.
	(b) Edge-in (Yip 1988) takes care of the association of edge consonants
	with edge skeletal slots. (c) The realization of the nucleus abides
	by the order of N-placement, rising diphthong formation, and falling
	diphthong formation. (d) The sonority hierarchy of a &gt ɔ &gt e
	&gt o &gt i &gt u determines how vocoids are associated with the
	nucleus position. If there is a tie, the first segment gets linked
	by temporal sequence. V-neutralization (Chung 1996) turns mid vowels
	into high when they form rimes with the adjacent vowels. (e) The
	contracted form abides by Maximality (Prince 1985) to construct the
	largest possible syllable. (f) In addition, stress is shown irrelevant,
	and phonotactic constraints may be contravened.},

  abstract = {Many questions in evolutionary biology are best addressed by comparing
	traits in different species. Often such studies involve mapping characters
	on phylogenetic trees. Mapping characters on trees allows the nature,
	number, and timing of the transformations to be identified. The parsimony
	method is the only method available for mapping morphological characters
	on phylogenies. Although the parsimony method often makes reasonable
	reconstructions of the history of a character, it has a number of
	limitations. These limitations include the inability to consider
	more than a single change along a branch on a tree and the uncoupling
	of evolutionary time from amount of character change. We extended
	a method described by Nielsen (2002, Syst. Biol. 51:729-739) to the
	mapping of morphological characters under continuous-time Markov
	models and demonstrate here the utility of the method for mapping
	characters on trees and for identifying character correlation.},

	leads to a categorical distinction (‘small/not-small’) rather than
	a quantitative, continuous grading of networks, and can lead to uncertainty
	about a network's small-world status. Moreover, systems described
	by small-world networks are often studied using an equivalent canonical
	network model – the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model. However, the process
	of establishing an equivalent WS model is imprecise and there is
	a pressing need to discover ways in which this equivalence may be
	quantified.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We
	defined a precise measure of ‘small-world-ness’ <italic>S</italic>
	based on the trade off between high local clustering and short path
	length. A network is now deemed a ‘small-world’ if <italic>S</italic>&gt;1
	- an assertion which may be tested statistically. We then examined
	the behavior of <italic>S</italic> on a large data-set of real-world
	systems. We found that all these systems were linked by a linear
	relationship between their <italic>S</italic> values and the network
	size <italic>n</italic>. Moreover, we show a method for assigning
	a unique Watts-Strogatz (WS) model to any real-world network, and
	show analytically that the WS models associated with our sample of
	networks also show linearity between <italic>S</italic> and <italic>n</italic>.
	Linearity between <italic>S</italic> and <italic>n</italic> is not,
	however, inevitable, and neither is <italic>S</italic> maximal for
	an arbitrary network of given size. Linearity may, however, be explained
	by a common limiting growth process.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We
	have shown how the notion of a small-world network may be quantified.
	Several key properties of the metric are described and the use of
	WS canonical models is placed on a more secure footing.</p></sec>},

	by a rooted phylogenetic tree. While it is generally undisputed that
	bifurcating speciation events and descent with modifications are
	major forces of evolution, there is a growing belief that reticulate
	events also have a role to play. Phylogenetic networks provide an
	alternative to phylogenetic trees and may be more suitable for datasets
	where evolution involves significant amounts of reticulate events
	such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer or recombination.
	In this article, we give an introduction to the topic of phylogenetic
	networks, very briefly describing the fundamental concepts and summarizing
	some of the most important combinatorial methods that are available

  abstract = {This review describes some recent, unexpected findings concerning
	variation in spatial language across cultures, and places them in
	the context of the general anthropology of space on the one hand,
	and theories of spatial cognition in the cognitive sciences on the
	other. There has been much concern with the symbolism of space in
	anthropological writings, but little on concepts of space in practical
	activities. This neglect of everyday spatial notions may be due to
	unwitting ethnocentrism, the assumption in Western thinking generally
	that notions of space are universally of a single kind. Recent work
	shows that systems of spatial reckoning and description can in fact
	be quite divergent across cultures, linguistic differences correlating
	with distinct cognitive tendencies. This unexpected cultural variation
	raises interesting questions concerning the relation between cultural
	and linguistic concepts and the biological foundations of cognition.
	It argues for more sophisticated models relating culture and cognition
	than we currently have available.},

	an important role in the formation of East Asian populations and
	led to a high degree of cultural diversity among ethnic minorities
	living in these areas. To explore the genetic relationships of these
	ethnic minorities, we systematically surveyed the variation of 10
	autosomal STR markers of 1,538 individuals from 30 populations of
	25 ethnic minorities, of which the majority were chosen from Southwest
	China, especially Yunnan Province. With genotyped data of the markers,
	we constructed phylogenies of these populations with both <italic>D<sub>A</sub></italic>
	and <italic>D<sub>C</sub></italic> measures and performed a principal
	component analysis, as well as a clustering analysis by <italic>structure</italic>.
	Results showed that we successfully recovered the genetic structure
	of analyzed populations formed by historical migrations. Aggregation
	patterns of these populations accord well with their linguistic affiliations,
	suggesting that deciphering of genetic relationships does in fact
	offer clues for study of ethnic differentiation.</p>},

	to an interesting and still open problem, namely, explicating the
	concept of a system that seems to unify the interests of researchers
	in this area. Contrary to received opinion, I argue that there is
	a unique and interesting concept of a system that underlies the expressed
	interests of general systems researchers and that it can be given
	a satisfactory explication. The concept in question has systems as
	extralinguistic entities that we theorize about, namely, certain
	sorts of sets of re-related elements. Criteria for its explication
	are suggested; examples of systems, earlier analyses, and various
	objections are all considered in leading up to a partial formal explication
	of the concept and a statement of additional open problems.},

  abstract = {Language evolution is traditionally described in terms of family trees
	with ancestral languages splitting into descendent languages. However,
	it has long been recognized that language evolution also entails
	horizontal components, most commonly through lexical borrowing. For
	example, the English language was heavily influenced by Old Norse
	and Old French; eight per cent of its basic vocabulary is borrowed.
	Borrowing is a distinctly non-tree-like process—akin to horizontal
	gene transfer in genome evolution—that cannot be recovered by phylogenetic
	trees. Here, we infer the frequency of hidden borrowing among 2346
	cognates (etymologically related words) of basic vocabulary distributed
	across 84 Indo-European languages. The dataset includes 124 (5%)
	known borrowings. Applying the uniformitarian principle to inventory
	dynamics in past and present basic vocabularies, we find that 1373
	(61%) of the cognates have been affected by borrowing during their
	history. Our approach correctly identified 117 (94%) known borrowings.
	Reconstructed phylogenetic networks that capture both vertical and
	horizontal components of evolutionary history reveal that, on average,
	eight per cent of the words of basic vocabulary in each Indo-European
	language were involved in borrowing during evolution. Basic vocabulary
	is often assumed to be relatively resistant to borrowing. Our results
	indicate that the impact of borrowing is far more widespread than
	previously thought.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting communities or modules in networks,
	groups of vertices with a higher-than-average density of edges connecting
	them. Previous work indicates that a robust approach to this problem
	is the maximization of the benefit function known as “modularity”
	over possible divisions of a network. Here we show that this maximization
	process can be written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix
	we call the modularity matrix, which plays a role in com- munity
	detection similar to that played by the graph Laplacian in graph
	partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a number of possible
	algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several
	other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure
	in networks and a new centrality measure that identifies those vertices
	that occupy central positions within the communities to which they
	belong. The algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with
	applications to a variety of real-world complex networks.},

	first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to
	split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using
	any one of a number of possible ” betweenness” measures, and second,
	these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We
	also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure
	found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing
	the number of communities into which a network should be divided.
	We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering
	community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network
	data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes
	dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.}},

  abstract = {«The Natural System» is the name given to the underlying arrangement
	present in the diversity of life. Unlike a classification, which
	is made up of classes and members, a system or arrangement is an
	integrated whole made up of connected parts. In the pre-evolutionary
	period a variety of forms were proposed for the Natural System, including
	maps, circles, stars, and abstract multidimensional objects. The
	trees sketched by Darwin in the 1830s should probably be considered
	the first genuine evolutionary diagrams of the Natural System—the
	first genuine evolutionary trees. Darwin refined his image of the
	Natural System in the well-known evolutionary tree published in the
	Origin of Species, where he also carefully distinguished between
	arrangements and classifications. Following the publication of the
	Origin, there was a great burst of evolutionary tree building, but
	interest in trees declined substantially after 1900, only to be revived
	in recent years with the development of cladistic analysis.
	
	While evolutionary trees are modern diagrams of the Natural System,
	they are at the same time instances of another broad class of diagrams
	that may be called «trees of history»: branching diagrams of genealogical
	descent and change. During the same years that Darwin was sketching
	his first evolutionary trees, the earliest examples of two other
	trees of history also appeared: the first trees of language evolution
	and of manuscript genealogy. Though these were apparently independent
	of evolutionary trees in their origin, the similarities among all
	these trees of history, and among the historical processes that underlie
	them, were soon recognized. Darwin compared biological evolution
	and language evolution several times in the Origin of Species, and
	both Ernst Haeckel and the linguist August Schleicher made similar
	comparisons. Both linguists and stemmaticists (students of manuscript
	descent) understood the principle of apomorphy—the principle that
	only shared innovations provide evidence of common ancestry—more
	clearly than did systematists, and if there had been more cross-fertilization
	among these fields the cladistic revolution in systematics might
	well have taken place in the nineteenth century.
	
	Although historical linguists and stemmaticists have in some respects
	had sounder theory than have systematists, at least until recently,
	they have also had the practical problem of very large amounts of
	data, a problem not often faced by systematists until the advent
	of molecular sequencing. The opportunity now exists for systematists
	to contribute to the theory and practice of linguistics and stemmatics,
	their sister disciplines in historical reconstruction, through application
	of our commonly used computer programs for tree estimation. Preliminary
	results from the application of numerical cladistic analysis to a
	large stemmatic data set have been very encouraging, and have already
	generated much discussion in the stemmatics community.},

  abstract = {We describe a Bayesian method for investigating correlated evolution
	of discrete binary traits on phylogenetic trees. The method fits
	a continuous‐time Markov model to a pair of traits, seeking the best
	fitting models that describe their joint evolution on a phylogeny.
	We employ the methodology of reversible‐jump (RJ) Markov chain Monte
	Carlo to search among the large number of possible models, some of
	which conform to independent evolution of the two traits, others
	to correlated evolution. The RJ Markov chain visits these models
	in proportion to their posterior probabilities, thereby directly
	estimating the support for the hypothesis of correlated evolution.
	In addition, the RJ Markov chain simultaneously estimates the posterior
	distributions of the rate parameters of the model of trait evolution.
	These posterior distributions can be used to test among alternative
	evolutionary scenarios to explain the observed data. All results
	are integrated over a sample of phylogenetic trees to account for
	phylogenetic uncertainty. We implement the method in a program called
	RJ Discrete and illustrate it by analyzing the question of whether
	mating system and advertisement of estrus by females have coevolved
	in the Old World monkeys and great apes.},

	the interrelationships of diagnosable taxa (those with unique sets
	of apomorphic characters) can be investigated, questions about whether
	speciation can occur without branching, or whether species become
	extinct at branching points, are irrelevant to cladistic practice.
	The distinction between plesiomorphic and apomorphic character states
	depends not on the reconstruction of actual evolutionary history,
	but on the discrimination of more general from less general characters;
	groups based on plesiomorphy are defined by the absence of characters
	and are therefore artificial. Hence cladistic methods are not the
	methods of phylogenetics per se, but the methods of natural classification
	in general; phylogenetic conclusions are an extrapolation from hypotheses
	about natural order.},

	27:1-16.-Historical explanations of biotic distribution fall into
	two classes, dispersal explanations and vicariance explanations.
	Dispersal models explain disjunctions by dispersal across pre-existing
	barriers, vicariance models by the appearance of barriers fragmenting
	the ranges of ancestral species. Distributional data seem insufficient
	to resolve decisively either dispersal or vicariance as the cause
	of particular allopatric distribution patterns. When faced with such
	a pattern our first question should therefore be directed not to
	its cause, but to whether or not it conforms to a general pattern
	of relationships shown by taxa endemic to the areas occupied. Two-taxon
	statements are always compatible with a general pattern; three-taxon
	statements are therefore the most basic possible units of biogeographic
	(as well as phylogenetic) analysis. Analysis of three-taxon statements
	involves converting a hypothesis about the interrelationships of
	taxa (a cladogram indicating relative recency of common ancestry)
	to one concerning the interrelationships of areas (a cladogram indicating
	relative recency of common ancestral biotas). The generality of the
	area hypothesis may be tested by comparison with other groups endemic
	to the relevant areas. If the area hypothesis is corroborated as
	general, a statement of the relative recency of interconnections
	among areas is obtained, and evidence from historical geology may
	allow us to specify the nature of those interconnections and thereby
	the cause of those distributions that conform to the general pattern.
	Analysis of four-taxon statements indicates that the availability
	of structurally different patterns and of groups that can serve as
	adequate tests of the generality of those patterns increases with
	the addition of taxa to the hypothesis, and that neither extinction
	nor the failure of some groups to respond (by speciating) to given
	dispersal or vicariance events interferes with the analysis.},

  abstract = {<p>Historical linguistics aims at inferring the most likely language
	phylogenetic tree starting from information concerning the evolutionary
	relatedness of languages. The available information are typically
	lists of homologous (lexical, phonological, syntactic) features or
	characters for many different languages: a set of parallel corpora
	whose compilation represents a paramount achievement in linguistics.</p>
	<p>From this perspective the reconstruction of language trees is
	an example of inverse problems: starting from present, incomplete
	and often noisy, information, one aims at inferring the most likely
	past evolutionary history. A fundamental issue in inverse problems
	is the evaluation of the inference made. A standard way of dealing
	with this question is to generate data with artificial models in
	order to have full access to the evolutionary process one is going
	to infer. This procedure presents an intrinsic limitation: when dealing
	with real data sets, one typically does not know which model of evolution
	is the most suitable for them. A possible way out is to compare algorithmic
	inference with expert classifications. This is the point of view
	we take here by conducting a thorough survey of the accuracy of reconstruction
	methods as compared with the Ethnologue expert classifications. We
	focus in particular on state-of-the-art <italic>distance-based</italic>
	methods for phylogeny reconstruction using worldwide linguistic databases.</p>
	<p>In order to assess the accuracy of the inferred trees we introduce
	and characterize two generalizations of standard definitions of distances
	between trees. Based on these scores we quantify the relative performances
	of the distance-based algorithms considered. Further we quantify
	how the completeness and the coverage of the available databases
	affect the accuracy of the reconstruction. Finally we draw some conclusions
	about where the accuracy of the reconstructions in historical linguistics
	stands and about the leading directions to improve it.</p>},

	in his 1837 notebook, and depicted a tree in the Origin of Species
	(1859). Here I attempt to place Darwin's trees in historical context.
	By the mid-Eighteenth century the Great Chain of Being was increasingly
	seen to be an inadequate description of order in nature, and by about
	1780 it had been largely abandoned without a satisfactory alternative
	having been agreed upon. In 1750 Donati described aquatic and terrestrial
	organisms as forming a network, and a few years later Buffon depicted
	a network of genealogical relationships among breeds of dogs. In
	1764 Bonnet asked whether the Chain might actually branch at certain
	points, and in 1766 Pallas proposed that the gradations among organisms
	resemble a tree with a compound trunk, perhaps not unlike the tree
	of animal life later depicted by Eichwald. Other trees were presented
	by Augier in 1801 and by Lamarck in 1809 and 1815, the latter two
	assuming a transmutation of species over time. Elaborate networks
	of affinities among plants and among animals were depicted in the
	late Eighteenth and very early Nineteenth centuries. In the two decades
	immediately prior to 1837, so-called affinities and/or analogies
	among organisms were represented by diverse geometric figures. Series
	of plant and animal fossils in successive geological strata were
	represented as trees in a popular textbook from 1840, while in 1858
	Bronn presented a system of animals, as evidenced by the fossil record,
	in a form of a tree. Darwin's 1859 tree and its subsequent elaborations
	by Haeckel came to be accepted in many but not all areas of biological
	sciences, while network diagrams were used in others. Beginning in
	the early 1960s trees were inferred from protein and nucleic acid
	sequences, but networks were re-introduced in the mid-1990s to represent
	lateral genetic transfer, increasingly regarded as a fundamental
	mode of evolution at least for bacteria and archaea. In historical
	context, then, the Network of Life preceded the Tree of Life and
	might again supersede it.REVIEWERS:This article was reviewed by Eric

  title = {Reversing Babel - Declining linguistic diversity and the flawed attempts
	to protect it},
  year = {2009},
  abstract = {This is an investigation about linguistic diversity, examining its
	decline in different societal conditions over the last century, and
	interrogating claims in language policy and planning to be ‘protecting
	linguistic diversity’, using the UK as its main example. Chapter
	1 comprises a review of variationist sociolinguistics, showing how
	it has never fully defined linguistic diversity. Adjustments are
	suggested, and a working definition of linguistic diversity offered.
	Chapter 2 presents data from two major nationwide dialect surveys,
	in 1889 and 1962, showing how local dialects were weakening in this
	period. The main focus is declining diversity, but information is
	presented about possible conditioning factors, primarily increases
	in literacy. In the absence of such nationwide reports after 1962,
	Chapter 3 collates individual dialect studies from two regions of
	England, the northeast and southeast, describing dialect convergence
	across these large geographical areas. These changes are contrasted
	to those reported in Chapter 2. Again the main theme is declining
	diversity, but information is reviewed to help explain these contrasts,
	primarily increases in geographical mobility in the latter half of
	the 20th century, concentrated around these regions. Chapter 4 examines
	dialect weakening that some researchers have attributed, at least
	in part, to the media. This also represents a change in societal
	conditions undergirding declining diversity. Some theoretical work
	is done to distinguish such changes from those observed in Chapter
	3. Chapter 5 reviews the rhetoric of minority language policy and
	planning, and its frequent and explicit claims to be ‘protecting
	linguistic diversity’. The insights developed in Chapters 1-4 are
	applied to two modern UK language revivals, Cornish and Welsh, to
	see how diversity overall is faring here. The conclusion sums up
	the gaps in our thinking about linguistic diversity, and clarifies
	the limitations of planned interventions upon language.},

	acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages
	according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly,
	residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties
	in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions
	rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early
	alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap
	penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions.

  abstract = { <p>Multiple comparison or alignmentof protein sequences has become
	a fundamental tool in many different domains in modern molecular
	biology, from evolutionary studies to prediction of 2D/3D structure,
	molecular function and inter-molecular interactions etc. By placing
	the sequence in the framework of the overall family, multiple alignments
	can be used to identify conserved features and to highlight differences
	or specificities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive evaluation
	of many of the most popular methods for multiple sequence alignment
	(MSA), based on a new benchmark test set. The benchmark is designed
	to represent typical problems encountered when aligning the large
	protein sequence sets that result from today's high throughput biotechnologies.
	We show that alignmentmethods have significantly progressed and can
	now identify most of the shared sequence features that determine
	the broad molecular function(s) of a protein family, even for divergent
	sequences. However,we have identified a number of important challenges.
	First, the locally conserved regions, that reflect functional specificities
	or that modulate a protein's function in a given cellular context,are
	less well aligned. Second, motifs in natively disordered regions
	are often misaligned. Third, the badly predicted or fragmentary protein
	sequences, which make up a large proportion of today's databases,
	lead to a significant number of alignment errors. Based on this study,
	we demonstrate that the existing MSA methods can be exploited in
	combination to improve alignment accuracy, although novel approaches
	will still be needed to fully explore the most difficult regions.
	We then propose knowledge-enabled, dynamic solutions that will hopefully
	pave the way to enhanced alignment construction and exploitation
	in future evolutionary systems biology studies.</p> },
